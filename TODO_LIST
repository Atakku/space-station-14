Brigmed wall locker empty
	Replaced with 'medicine wall locker [Filled]'
	Still empty
Armory needs more armor
Bridge front window very prone to spacing
Engineering break room also prone to spacing
Solars prone to meteor breakages
Expand/reposition solars
Figure out wrong-facing wall TVs, telescreens, nanomeds (others?)
Command Meeting: Needs access to execution cameras
Execution telescreens: Need access to execution cameras
Weird color room in east service maints starts with lights on
Weapons weapons have machine boards in 'em! Gotta break those, too
Chef's closets have stuff in 'em they shouldn't? Like, crowbars and N2 tanks.
Tider shop: Maybe rotate shutters
Cargo computer shutter button seems not to be hooked up.
	It is, though...? Does the directional window block it?
Cargo shuttle computer can't find the shuttle. Mass scanner says it's out there...

Grime everything up a bit again.

Holopad perms
Janitor air alarm not powered, even when power is fixed.
	Moved Admin cable away a bit, maybe did the trick?
Tider shop:
	Should also be a light by the door. Maybe it turns off when
		door is bolted?
		Added one. CHECK IF IT WORKS. Make sure door's still
			bolted at start, too.
Execution telescreens see mounted cam networks, not wireless.
	Having trouble figuring out where this is specified, so maybe I should
		dig into the components while testing live.
- Make sure I can interact with posters correctly
AI scrubber vent pump starts off
	Turned it on, should check it sticks when live
	If this works, probs turn on some other Atmos stuff, too
Check lighting

Also: When I'm testing in Release mode, I get these exceptions in the server terminal 
	about the no transform component thing. Can I use those to hunt it
	down live?
On the second try I never got this exception. Maybe I just never visited that part of the station?
