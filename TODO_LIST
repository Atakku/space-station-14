-	Make flare spent
--			Give: Passenger PDA/ID (name?), Ancient jumpsuit, gas mask, budget insuls,
				shoes, bling, ID computer board in pocket
- Stuff that gets flushed down toilets, aside from the mime and clowns', goes to the QM's shower for some reason.
	Figure out mail chutes first, though.
Evac:
-	Rename + fill ore crates
-	Decals, of course
- Make the station move forward!
- Job numbers in the prototype file
Figure out wrong-facing wall TVs, telescreens, nanomeds (others?)
Command Meeting: Needs access to execution cameras
Execution telescreens: Need access to execution cameras
Weird color room in east service maints starts with lights on
Weapons weapons have machine boards in 'em! Gotta break those, too
Chef's closets have stuff in 'em they shouldn't? Like, crowbars and N2 tanks.
Cargo computer shutter button seems not to be hooked up.
	It is, though...? Does the directional window block it?
Cargo shuttle computer can't find the shuttle. Mass scanner says it's out there...
Forms for things like borging, department access, psych prescriptions...
	Make lots of forms for HoP, too
		Hall/Bathroom Pass
		Official requisition form requisition form
		Complaints
		Opinion Registration
		Tattle Form
		ID Card Alteration Request
		All Access Request
		Some Access Request
		No Access Request
Custom books on lawyer shelves?
Among Us "clues" on detective notice boards
Put something in that space in the chapel's SE room
	Something for Remilla to perch on or w/e?
		Fruit for the fruit bat! Blood for the blood gods!
Decals under chapel windows
Papers on the ground? for explaining things to
	lawyers on spawn
	Or maybe I just put one spawn in each office and
	let them figure it out from there. Maybe a paper
	on each table. Like, a "congrats! You've passed the
	NT bar exam for: Defense Attorney!"
Shrink or move HoP tunnel to expand Atmos a bit more?
Would it be too radical to totally left/right swap the Atmos
	gas chambers so that the disposal pipeline linkup is less terrible?
	This impacts distro pipeline as well, naturally, so dunno.
	It might be nice to have the spaced area between the tanks
		and the burn chamber, just for a bit of a buffer zone.
		Ditto the public hallway, too, though...
Fill CMO's special syringe
Cryo piping
Check various shuttle designs to make sure docking arms line up with at least some
Telecoms: Change reinforced walls?
Glass doors at sec -> hall
Move warden's office?
Double-check reinforced walls around substations
Make easier to navigate in general, + add standard colors around more
	Maybe crappy scribble decals on top of the MIRI flooring?
Make HoP's office clearer in particular
Reinforce canister room walls
Take out empty trit can?
Remove riveted walls in storage
Deal with very long TEG pipeline somehow.
TEG just engi doors
Swap nuke/PA? Move nuke to vault?
Move oxy miner to where the other gasses are?
Liquid carbon dioxide can hooked up to condenser behind bar is wrong?
Set ejection chamber button access (cap and HoS)
Nudge wall sign transform variables to make them line up better

The big things:
Set up evac shuttle (possibly shrink it, too)
Cafeteria firelocks
Cafeteria floor
Mail chutes
Possibly move Evac farther out to make room for shuttle
	at north dock.
Check AI vision
Grime everything up a bit again.

Check this stuff:
Holopads with custom names that aren't generic holopads
Holopad perms
Janitor air alarm not powered, even when power is fixed.
	Moved Admin cable away a bit, maybe did the trick?
Tider shop:
	Should also be a light by the door. Maybe it turns off when
		door is bolted?
		Added one. CHECK IF IT WORKS. Make sure door's still
			bolted at start, too.
Execution telescreens see mounted cam networks, not wireless.
	Having trouble figuring out where this is specified, so maybe I should
		dig into the components while testing live.
- Make sure I can interact with posters correctly
AI scrubber vent pump starts off
	Turned it on, should check it sticks when live
	If this works, probs turn on some other Atmos stuff, too
Check lighting
Make sure arrivals meteor shield didn't block the shuttle
Make sure det/prosc door switches do what they're supposed to. Especially wrt the shutter.


THINGS I COULD MAKE:
- Plastic table
- Round table ends
- Random wall girder things
- Wood but it's darker (and lighter?)
- Feather, whip for prosecutor - and defense/prosecution signs?
-- Also a toupee for when they're feeling payne.
-- And a dang gavel
- Huge thrusters?

/* --	"Crewmember name: Crewmember color: Amount of susness (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10) */
/* 		Reason for suspicion: -Vented -Faked a task -Walked away from a body -Didn't fix lights -I just don't like them" */
/* 		"Are they also a baka? *Yes/*No */

/* 	Inaprovaline - Stimulant */
/* 	Ephedrine/Desoxyephedrine - More powerful stimulants + anti-narcolepsy */
/* 	Lipozine - Low appetite */
/* 	Mannitol - Restores brain damage */
/* 	Psicodine - Suppresses anxiety and mental distress */
/* 	Laughter - Antidepressant */
/* 	Happiness - Serious biz antidepressant, should probably mix with Mannitol */
