MAYBE:
Would it be too radical to totally left/right swap the Atmos
	gas chambers so that the disposal pipeline linkup is less terrible?
	This impacts distro pipeline as well, naturally, so dunno.
	It might be nice to have the spaced area between the tanks
		and the burn chamber, just for a bit of a buffer zone.
		Ditto the public hallway, too, though...
Take out empty trit can?
Deal with very long TEG pipeline somehow.
Swap nuke/PA? Move nuke to vault?
Move oxy miner to where the other gasses are?


TECHNICAL:
Figure out wrong-facing wall TVs, telescreens, nanomeds (others?)
-I am wrong about sec monitors being restricted to general.
-Wired/wireless network component apparently has nothing to do with entertainment/security

DECALING:
Make easier to navigate in general, + add standard colors around more
	Maybe crappy scribble decals on top of the MIRI flooring?
Grime everything up a bit again.
Fix decals under west electrical maints

OTHER:
Remove evac shuttle grid

Check this stuff:
Execution telescreens see mounted cam networks, not wireless.
	Having trouble figuring out where this is specified, so maybe I should
		dig into the components while testing live.
Salvage space area still being weird in atmo?
Evac shuttle good now?
Cryo beaker good now?
-Check roundstart tider shop light again. I turned the attached switch on. Did that break the door being bolted?
	Light is still on anyway. :/ IG, it's set to on in the PoweredLight component?
	I *might* have been testing the wrong version.
-"scrap circuitry" item in shuttle guns instead of PA boards.

THINGS I COULD MAKE:
- Plastic table
- Round table ends
- Random wall girder things
- Wood but it's darker (and lighter?)
- Feather, whip for prosecutor - and defense/prosecution signs?
-- Also a toupee for when they're feeling payne.
-- And a dang gavel
- Huge thrusters?
