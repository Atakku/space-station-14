MAYBE:
Would it be too radical to totally left/right swap the Atmos
	gas chambers so that the disposal pipeline linkup is less terrible?
	This impacts distro pipeline as well, naturally, so dunno.
	It might be nice to have the spaced area between the tanks
		and the burn chamber, just for a bit of a buffer zone.
		Ditto the public hallway, too, though...
Deal with very long TEG pipeline somehow.
Swap nuke/PA? Move nuke to vault?
Move oxy miner to where the other gasses are?
Could maybe still get the circuit scrap into the shuttle guns, just not as a machine board? Would it fit in a different containter category?

TECHNICAL:
-I am wrong about sec monitors being restricted to general.
Telescreens: Wallmount components to 180 and 270 degrees.
	No, 0 and 90 degrees?
	No, 180 and 270 degrees? ???
Nanomeds and wall televisions were right, and now they're wrong again?
	And now they're right again?
		Just like in a long, long trailer
	And now they're wrong again. I dun't geddit.

SHUTTERS:
Library shutter won't shut over closed doors
Chapel doors also have the shutter problem
Meeting room shutter *also* won't close over camera. Why shutters so much no work!?

OTHER:
Where's the storage fix wiring maints door even getting power from now?
	Literally the tiny dot of wiring under the APC directly.
Maybe replace a couple of the firelocks in caf with small ones and change the tiling or something
	to make paths clearer?

Check this stuff:

THINGS I COULD MAKE:
- Plastic table
- Round table ends
- Random wall girder things
- Wood but it's darker (and lighter?)
- Feather, whip for prosecutor - and defense/prosecution signs?
-- Also a toupee for when they're feeling payne.
-- And a dang gavel
- Huge thrusters?
