- Psych: A few drugs, such as Ethyloxyephedrine, Inaprovaline, Laughter, and Psicodine
-	Also, a paper explaining which drugs are of interest to the psychologist
-	These:
	Ethyloxyephedrine/Diphenylmethylamine - For drowsiness/narcolepsy
	Haloperidol - For removing hallucination
	Inaprovaline - Stimulant
	Ephedrine/Desoxyephedrine - More powerful stimulants + anti-narcolepsy
	Lipozine - Low appetite
	Mannitol - Restores brain damage
	Psicodine - Suppresses anxiety and mental distress
	Laughter - Antidepressant
	Happiness - Serious biz antidepressant, should probably mix with Mannitol
	Impedrezene - Slows down the brain
	Mute Toxin - Stops overtalkativeness
	Chloral Hydrate - Sleeping problems
	Nocturine - Sleeping problems (Chem can't actually make this without Vestine tho)
	Pax - Anger management problems
	THX - For people who need to chill out more
- Make sure this cabinet also only unlocks for the right perms
- Relabel holopad

- Maints "Bar": Two papers - one explaining the maints bar contest, the second responding to the tiny little maints bar and encouraging people to do better.

Things to fix:
-Arrivals going to wrong dock
/* -Lights around command table */
Station beacons:
	Cafeteria
	Shields
	/* Captain (double) */
	Execution, Airlock
	Storage
	Electrical
	/* Brig (double) */
	Evac Medbay
	Medbay
	Restaurant
	/* Service Docking Arm (double) */
	High-sec brig
	Reactor
	Nuke Chamber
	/* AI Dock (says "General") */
	Both Lawyers
	/* Chem (double) */
	Sec: labels too crowded
	/* Execution: Labels too long */
	/* Nuke chamber: Label too long */
	/* Cryopod + Surgery: Move one above */
	Wait, a bunch of these just turned on...? Maybe a power issue.
Air sensors: Cafeteria? Meeting? Chapel + Def? Library + News? Botany + Kitchen? TEG? AI Dock?
	Little compartments like: High-sec brig desk, cams at sec, interrogation room cell...
	Also high-sec brigs antechamber, armory front section
	coms chamber
	Hallway next to robotics
	Admin table public computer
	Admin atmos corner
	Inner storage
	Maints chapel
	Nuke room
	AI approach airlock?
	South AME mini-maints
	Bathroom stalls?
	Little room next to engie front
	Evac escape pod
	Evac maints airlock and little room that I forget if it's a substation?
	^ I think these all need to be hooked up to an air alarm?
		Some of them already have sensors.
	Arrivals and service dock are spaced! Science seems leaky, too? Maybe? (But not the arti room?)

Airlocks:
	Atmos
	Salv Shuttle
	Evac escape pod
	Evac secondary dock
	Evac maints
	Perma entrance
	Engie - PA grid

Label buttons:
	Atmos

/* Atmos needs wires */
/* Def/prosc signs: Hidden under disposal chute and wires */
"Distribution Loop: No data available"
	Gas sensor for distro loop now has LV cable. Did that fix it?
Camera monitors not finding camera networks
/* Two Hamlet cages, and both fell off the table. */
/* Captain's suit room door unpowered (and this room kinda sucks in general) */
/* Should put something at end of maints hallway just north of Nav hall */
/* Should put something in chamber in maints NW of shields */
Mice in sci mice crate no air
Arti analyzers not connected (Am I sure I want to fix this?)
/* Maints dart room no power */
Disposals north door no power...?
Coms room runs through its battery really dang quick
	Over 10000 W
	Replaced with High Cap. Two higher levels possible.
Admin also runs dry on power right quick (Load: 5409 W)
	Replaced with High Cap.
/* HoP's personal room kinda boring */
/* Secret door from chapel to law...? Is this a good idea? */
/* Second chapel door shutter not connected */
	/* Yes it was, but I extended an LV cable a bit */
/* Execution room doors both overlapping with wall */
/* Inner doors, too */
/* Execution audience telescreen not accessible (wrong facing?) */
/* Disposals airlock last row of belts (under blast doors) not linked to */
	/* execution room button */
/* Trash in disposals airlock can get stuck under plastic flaps */
Execution rites room telescreen also finds no cams
Storage NW maints door *does* have power
	At both ends
		Moved some LV cables from other circuits away
	But inner doors don't
		They should! They're connected to the rest of the maints wiring.
/* Tools table has a big empty spot */
/* Cargo conveyor belt plastic flaps missing occluder */
Mid-cargo maints: Grilles don't actually block vision
	What if I just added an occluder component to them...?
	Do they block vision in the context of only PDA light?
	/* and glass walls do block fun */
Mid electrical hallway doors: Only top one powered? This is the case in multiple places?
Cargo dock conveyor belts are probably wrong
/* Salv conveyor belt outer lever not hooked up */
/* Salv docking bay/shuttle workshop: No power at all? */
/* Asphalt shows cables + disposal chutes */
Medbay wallmount nanomeds facing wrong way
	Re-added facing south. Lights might also be blocking?
/* CMO locker right in front of the door for some reason? */
"Surgery" in maints: Grilles still don't block LoS
/* Librarian shutter button not hooked up */
	Yes it is.
/* Library rear wall (where the air alarm is) really feels like */
	/* it could use a door or something? */
/* Chempendium in chem just kinda sitting on the floor */
/* Brigmed locker blocking door */
/* 	Brigmed locker also has a disabler, sec headset, and stuff I */
/* 	don't want to just give to medics or w/e. */
Brigmed wall locker empty
	Replaced with 'medicine wall locker [Filled]'
/* Brigmed defib on top of air alarm */
/* Brig maints door not blocked by camera, needs better protected */
Prisoner wall closets also start empty
	Filled 'em
/* Interrogation room space law book just kinda sitting on the floor */
/* High-sec brig telepad facing wrong way */
	Replaced it with an east-facing one, but it already was east.
Armory needs more armor
/* Check wall TV facings - the one by EVA at least is wrong. */
	Nope. I think it was a power issue. They're very obvious when wrong.
Bridge front window very prone to spacing
Perma + high sec brig no eva suits for prisoners?
Could also use a sec locker
Engineering break room also prone to spacing
Solars prone to meteor breakages
/* Nitrogen closet by maints chapel is empty */
Weird color room in east service maints starts with lights on
Musician's formal closet starts empty?
NE solars: It'd be nice to have power monitoring
Weapons weapons have machine boards in 'em! Gotta break those, too
Chef's closets have stuff in 'em they shouldn't? Like, crowbars and N2 tanks.
/* Restaurant door bolt button not linked */
	Yes it is. (Restaurant restroom.)
	Could other bathroom stalls have these?
Tider shop: Maybe rotate shutters, maybe get rid of some of the counter frames - 
	or the disposal thingy - so it's less annoying to walk around in.

/* Security upper: APC not labeled or connected to LV */
Security hallway to brig second light on north wall is redundant
Deleting and replacing dispos north airlock that wasn't getting power
	seems to have fixed it...?
/* Unutilized substation above O2: Room is blocked by table/power monitor */
	Might be nice to place more power monitoring computers around
	in general.
Tree room: Blocked by grave and, uh, tree
/* Lockers behind clown's room are positioned weird. Possibly the */
	/* lightbulb is getting in the way? No, it was literally on top of a PACMAN somehow./*
Arrivals problem: The docks are just flat-out wrong. Should be, like, 5 wall tiles in between doors or something.
	I also need to double-check if the shuttle even fits in the space.

Make the "smokin'" room door not glass. More fun not to see it until you go in.
Rubbing alcohol is empty??
	Should be 'drink,' not 'food'
Make shutter over bar opening glass
I don't like the LED lights in the cafeteria. Maybe that's okay in Arrivals, but not Caf.
Firelocks between Arrivals and Docking Arm
Airlocks or at least tinyfans on shutter doors. And/or lock 'em.

Also: When I'm testing in Release mode, I get these exceptions in the server terminal 
	about the no transform component thing. Can I use those to hunt it
	down live?
On the second try I never got this exception. Maybe I just never visited that part of the station?

THINGS I COULD MAKE:
- Plastic table
- Round table ends
- Random wall girder things
- Wood but it's darker (and lighter?)
- Feather, whip for prosecutor - and defense/prosecution signs?
-- Also a toupee for when they're feeling payne.
-- And a dang gavel
- Huge thrusters?
